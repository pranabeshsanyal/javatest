go through all these classes, find the dependent objects.
create all dependent object either by using setter injection, constructor injection or field injection.

also find the sample main class to test all three classes.
both car, electric engine and CombustionEngine in the main class.

you can refere my example for more details.

you can use either spring boot or spring.
[ the process is different if you are using spring ]
